/* This is a placeholder file for the favicon.ico
   For a real project, you would want to create a proper .ico file using an image editor.
   The ICO file format is a container for multiple images at different sizes.
   
   In a real implementation, you would:
   1. Create an image with the Mangi Kikoba branding (M logo with gradient background)
   2. Save it in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
   3. Convert to .ico format
   
   For now, this file serves as a reminder to create the favicon.
